Module 13: Maintaining
and Monitoring Web Solutions in Azure

Lab: Deploying the Events Web Application to Azure
--------------------------------------------------

Scenario

Now that you have completed majority of the development of the Contoso
Events web application, it is time to start planning for the production
rollout. As part of the IT administration process, you need to document
the steps that are required to publish applications to Azure. To support
this goal, you need to deploy the Administration private web application
and Events public web application to your Azure account.

Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

Modify Web.config transformation files.

Deploy a cloud service project to Azure.

Deploy an ASP.NET Web Application project to Azure Websites.

View streaming logs for an Azure Website.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Before starting this lab, you must complete the lab in Module 2. For the
lab in this module, you will use the available host machine. Also, you
must complete the following steps:

1.  On the host computer, click **Start**, type **Remote**, and then
    click **Remote Desktop Connection**.

In Remote Desktop Connection, provide the name of your virtual machine
in the **Computer** box by using the following format:

**vm20532[*Your Name Here*].cloudapp.net:[*Your VM RDP Port*]**

> ![](media/image1.wmf) **Note:** The name and port for your virtual
> machine might be saved in the Computer drop-down list. If this is the
> case, use this value instead of typing it in manually. If you are
> unsure about your virtual machine’s RDP port, use either of the Azure
> portals to find your virtual machine’s endpoints. The endpoint with
> the name **Remote Desktop** is the correct port for RDP. This port is
> randomized to protect your virtual machine from unauthorized
> access.** **

In Remote Desktop Connection, click **Connect**. Wait until the RDP
client accesses the virtual machine.

If necessary, sign in by using the following credentials:

> User name: **Student**
>
> Password: **AzurePa\$\$w0rd**

Verify that you received the credentials to sign in to the Azure portal
from your training provider. You will use these credentials and the
Azure account throughout the labs in this course.

> Task]**

For the **Cloud** service configuration, locate the
**Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.ConnectionString** settings, and then
set the connection string by using the **Storage Account Name** and
**Primary** key recorded from the previous task.

View the **Local** service configuration settings and ensure that the
storage connection strings are using development storage.

Open the **Contoso.Events.Web** role’s property page.
