Module 6: Managing Cloud
Services in Azure

Lab: Creating a Background Process Using Azure Worker Roles
-----------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

The Contoso Events application currently requires an administrator to
generate a sign-in sheet Word document. However, this might become a
bottleneck when you want to scale the application. To void this, you
decided to redesign your solution so that the web front-end application
sends a request to generate a sign-in sheet. You also decided to create
a worker role to check these requests and generate the sign-in sheets.

In this lab, you will create a C\# Class Library project, add the
appropriate references, and then add the project as a Worker Role to
your cloud service. Then, you will use the Azure compute emulator to
test the web and worker roles.

Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

> Create a worker role from a C\# Class Library project.
>
> Implement the methods of the **RoleEntryPoint** class.
>
> Debug a worker role by using the Azure compute emulator.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

Before starting this lab, you must complete the lab in Module 2. For the
lab in this module, you will use the available host machine. Also, you
must complete the following steps:

> 1\. On the host computer, click **Start**, type **Remote**, and then
> click **Remote Desktop Connection**.
>
> 2\. In Remote Desktop Connection, provide the name of your virtual
> machine in the **Computer** box by using the following format:

**vm20532[Your Name Here].cloudapp.net:[Your VM RDP Port]**

> ![](media/image1.wmf) **Note:** The name and port for your virtual
> machine might be saved in the Computer drop-down list. If this is the
> case, use this value instead of typing it in manually. If you are
> unsure about your virtual machine’s RDP port, use either of the Azure
> portals to find your virtual machine’s endpoints. The endpoint with
> the name **Remote Desktop** is the correct port for RDP. This port is
> randomized to protect your virtual machine from unauthorized access.
>
> 3\. In Remote Desktop Connection, click **Connect**. Wait until the RDP
> client accesses the virtual machine.
>
> 4\. If necessary, sign in by using the following credentials:
>
> o User name: **Student**
>
> o Password: **AzurePa\$\$w0rd**
>
> 5\. Verify that you received the credentials to sign in to the Azure
> portal from your training provider. You will use these credentials and
> the Azure account throughout the labs in this course.

### Exercise 1: Creating a C\# Class Library

Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

> Create a C\# Class Library project.
>
> Add references to the ServiceRuntime DLLs.
>
> Create a class by inheriting from the **RoleEntryPoint** base class.
>
> Implement the **OnStart** and **Run** methods.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1\. Create a C\# Class Library project.

2\. Add a reference to the Azure SDK libraries and solution projects.

3\. Create a class inheriting from RoleEntryPoint.

4\. Implement the run logic to get requests from the SQL database.

####   Task 1: Create a C\# Class Library project {#task-1-create-a-c-class-library-project .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Open Visual Studio 2013 as an administrator.

2.  Open the **Contoso.Events** starter solution for Module 6:

-   File location: **Allfiles
    (F):\\Mod06\\Labfiles\\Starter\\Contoso.Events**

1.  Create a new **Visual C\# Class Library** project in the
    **Contoso.Events** solution by using the following name:

-   **Contoso.Events.Worker**

####   Task 2: Add a reference to the Azure SDK libraries and solution projects {#task-2-add-a-reference-to-the-azure-sdk-libraries-and-solution-projects .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Add a reference to the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime**
    library in the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project.

2.  Add a reference to the following projects in the **Contoso.Events**
    solution:

-   **Contoso.Events.Models**

-   **Contoso.Events.Data**

-   **Contoso.Events.Documents**

1.  By using the Package Manager Console, run the following command to
    target the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project:

Install-Package EntityFramework -Version 6.0.2

1.  Build the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project.

####   Task 3: Create a class inheriting from RoleEntryPoint {#task-3-create-a-class-inheriting-from-roleentrypoint .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Add a new class to the project with the name **WorkerRole**.

2.  Open the **WorkerRole** class.

3.  Change the accessor of the **WorkerRole** class to **public**.

4.  Redefine the class to inherit from the **RoleEntryPoint** base class
    in the **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime** namespace.

5.  Implement the **OnStart** method with a call to the base
    **OnStart()** method of the **RoleEntryPoint** class. The
    **OnStart** method should also set the
    **ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit** value to 12 before
    calling the base **OnStart()** method.

6.  Implement the **Run** method with a simple infinite **while** loop.
    The **Run** method should write to **Trace** by using the
    **Trace.WriteLine** method when it is run for the first time. Within
    the method’s **while** loop, a call to **Thread.Sleep** should be
    made for a duration of 10,000 milliseconds, and then a call to
    **Trace.WriteLine** should be made to indicate an iteration of the
    queue.

public override void Run()

{

Trace.WriteLine("Queue Run Start");

while (true)

{

Thread.Sleep(10000);

Trace.WriteLine("Queue Run Iteration");

}

}

####   Task 4: Implement the run logic to get requests from the SQL database {#task-4-implement-the-run-logic-to-get-requests-from-the-sql-database .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Add the **WorkerRole.cs** file to the **Contoso.Events.Worker**
    project:

-   File location: **Allfiles
    (F):\\Mod06\\Labfiles\\Starter\\WorkerRole.cs**

1.  Open the **App.config** file.

2.  Replace the content of the **App.config** file with the following
    XML code:

\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?\>

\<configuration\>

\<connectionStrings\>

\<add name="EventsContextConnectionString" connectionString="Data
Source=(localdb)\\v11.0;Initial
Catalog=EventsContextModule6Lab;Pooling=True;Integrated Security=True
providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /\>

\</connectionStrings\>

\</configuration\>

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have created a
Worker Role class library and implement the appropriate pattern for a
background worker.

### Exercise 2: Adding the Class Library to a Cloud Service Project

Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

> Add a Class Library project as a worker role in a cloud service
> project.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

> Add Class Library as a worker role to the cloud service project.

####   Task 1: Add Class Library as a worker role to the cloud service project {#task-1-add-class-library-as-a-worker-role-to-the-cloud-service-project .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Unload the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project from the
    **Contoso.Events** solution.

2.  Edit the **Contoso.Events.Worker.csproj** file to have the following
    element as a child of the **PropertyGroup** XML element:

-   **\<RoleType\>Worker\</RoleType\>**

1.  Reload the **Contoso.Events.Worker** project.

2.  Associate the **Contoso.Events.Worker** Class Library project with
    the **Contoso.Events.Cloud** Cloud Service project as a worker role.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have taken an
existing Class Library project and converted it into a worker role in an
existing cloud service project.

### Exercise 3: Debugging worker roles in a cloud service project

Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

> Add a breakpoint to a worker role.
>
> Debug the worker role and a web role by using the Azure compute
> emulator.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

> Debug the worker role.

####   Task 1: Debug the worker role {#task-1-debug-the-worker-role .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Debug the **Contoso.Events.Cloud** project.

> ![](media/image1.wmf) **Note:** Throughout this course we will use the
> **Azure Compute Emulator** to test and debug our Cloud Services. The
> emulator provides a fast and local option for testing your Cloud
> Services before deploying them to the Azure platform. Occasionally you
> may seem an odd error with the emulator such as an incorrect port
> number or a page not displaying. If this ever occurs, you can simply
> **Shutdown** the compute emulator and Visual Studio will **Start** the
> emulator the next time you try to debug your project.** **

1.  Navigate to any event page.

2.  Generate a sign-in sheet by clicking **Generate Sign-In Sheet** on
    the event page.

3.  Wait for the sign-in sheet to be generated, and then download the
    sign-in sheet.

4.  View the sign-in sheet (.docx file) in WordPad.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have debugged a
worker role.
